* Quarto files (qmd) go in here
* Any outputs (HTML, docx, PDF) and intermediaries (md) to be rendered into this folder too
* The R markdown file shouldn't contain substantial amounts of new analysis, this should be contained in scripts
* Follow Emily Riederer's [R-Markdown-driven development](https://emilyriederer.netlify.com/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/) principles
